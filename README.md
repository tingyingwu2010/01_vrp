# Vehicle Routing Problem

![PyTest](https://github.com/ifm-mag/01_vrp/workflows/PyTest/badge.svg)

## Objective
The objective of this repo is to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem using **established** deep Reinforcement Learning techniques, primarily (Nazari et. al 2018).

The stretch objective is to improve on this deep RL algorithm.

## Definition of success
**Task 1**: Replicate results from (Nazari et. al 2018)

**Task 1.1**: (Stretch) Replicate results from (Bello et. al 2017; Vinyals et. al 2017).

**Task 2**: (Stretch) Develop a stronger RL algorithm than Task 1
