# Vehicle Routing Problem

![PyTest](https://github.com/ifm-mag/01_vrp/workflows/PyTest/badge.svg) [![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/ifm-mag/01_vrp/branch/master/graph/badge.svg&service=github)](https://codecov.io/gh/ifm-mag/01_vrp)


## Objective
The objective of this repo is to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem using **established** deep Reinforcement Learning techniques, primarily (Nazari et. al 2018).

The stretch objective is to improve on this deep RL algorithm.

## Definition of success
**Task 1**: Replicate results from (Nazari et. al 2018)

**Task 1.1**: (Stretch) Replicate results from (Bello et. al 2017; Vinyals et. al 2017).

**Task 2**: (Stretch) Develop a stronger RL algorithm than Task 1

## Installation
Dependencies:

`Gym, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, PyTest, flake8, mypy`

Go to `src` and run `pip install -e .` which will identify the relevant files.

## Usage (TO DO)
VRPEnv5 is the CVRP problem with 5 destinations, 1 depot and 1 (capacitated vehicle).
